## How to use this
- Step 1: Enter Audit mode by pressing Ctrl + Shift + F3
- Step 2: Run the program as administrator
- Step 3: Enter your username and press Enter. Enjoy!
## Who is this for?
This program is primarily made for OEM computers with Windows preinstalled. If you're reinstalling Windows, consider creating "Autounattend.xml" instead of using this
## Why C++ and a lot of `system()` functions?
Because I am dumb.
## Plans for the future
- Simple PowerShell command that automatically download the executable and run it.
- Skip Audit mode entirely.
